<h3>Island Bird Fossil Database</h3>

This project is a database compiling published and unpublished information about the distribution and status of bird species on oceanic islands. The project was initiated by Alison Boyer's dissertation research in collaboration with David Steadman and Helen James and was continued over the years.

<b>List of Files:</b>

README.md	-- Generates this README

... .csv -- island bird occurrence data (species name, island, status)

... .csv -- species-level trait information

... .csv -- island-level environmental information

... .R simple database assembly and checking scripts


<b>How to contribute</b>

The goal is for this to be a dynamic, community database, not just an archived blob. Why? Well, these data undoubtedly have mistakes and omissions; the database could be structured more usefully for new analyses; and the dataset should be extended as new studies are published. Please contribute by forking this repository (using git) to make a copy of the data, just as if this were an open-source software project. You can then modify or add data and send me a pull request. Another way to help is to file a bug report on the Issues tab.
